siriushq/trivialnotes
=====================

	Simple editor implementations for Standard Notes <https://standardnotes.com>.
	Intentionally kept as minimal as possible. Install from our mirror as such:

		https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam/<editor>/extension.json

	...substituting the name of the editor you desire.
	Installation has only been tested working from the desktop client, but the
	editors function across all platforms, once installed.

editors
=======

	Editors that store serialized data are designed to not clash with each other
	or corrupt a note that may contain other data. It is not guaranteed that they
	will not clash with third-party editors not part of this repository.

	plain — a plain text editor that serves as the reference implementation for any
	        editors in this repository (and debugging tool for developing new ones).

	password — a password manager interface. this can store any kind of information
	           on top of the actual accounts themselves. it uses Brandfetch to get
	           logos for you, you should change client ID when using it (included one
	           is an anonymous default).

	authenticator — a TOTP authenticator interface that only stores a name and secret
	                for simple authentication, just like e.g. Okta Verify, except with
	                secure multi-device sync powered by StandardNotes.

	                note: this editor must be served over HTTPS due to limitations of
	                SubtleCrypto API <developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto>.

	monaco — an editor that uses Monaco <https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/>
	         for viewing and editing code samples.

	         note: if the content of a note is just pure JSON (i.e., it can be parsed
	         as JSON and it begins with either '{' or '[', the content will be
	         prettified for better viewing). prefix your note if you don't want this.

	sheets — an editor that uses Jspreadsheet CE <https://bossanova.uk/jspreadsheet/>
	         for viewing and editing spreadsheets, supporting copy-paste, etc.

development
===========

	To begin live editing, install Git & Bun and run the following commands:

	1. Clone the repository
	$ git clone git@github.com:siriushq/trivialnotes.git
	$ cd trivialnotes

	2. Point all extensions to localhost
	$ sed -i 's|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|http://localhost:8080|' plain/extension.json
	$ sed -i 's|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|http://localhost:8080|' password/extension.json
	$ sed -i 's|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|http://localhost:8080|' authenticator/extension.json
	$ sed -i 's|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|http://localhost:8080|' monaco/extension.json

	3. Run a live server for editing
	$ bunx http-server -p 8080 --cors .

	4. Revert change to extensions before contributing
	$ sed -i 's|http://localhost:8080|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|' plain/extension.json
	$ sed -i 's|http://localhost:8080|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|' password/extension.json
	$ sed -i 's|http://localhost:8080|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|' authenticator/extension.json
	$ sed -i 's|http://localhost:8080|https://trivialnotes.sirius.cam|' monaco/extension.json

contributing
============

	Contributions are accepted as long as they fall within implied project scope.

	All commits must contain at least `Signed-off-by` to identify the author of the
	contribution, and may contain `Co-authored-by` to attach any number of other
	authors (this can be added automatically with `git commit ... -s ...`).

	(furthermore, commits from people with repository write access are to be signed
	with a verified GPG, SSH or S/MIME signature attached to your GitHub account).

	By submitting a contribution, you certify that you and other authors are making
	your contribution available under the license of the project, and that you have
	the rights to submit it.

security
========

	Every editor here is trivial enough that anyone with programming experience
	should be able to audit it themselves with minimal hassle.

	You may wish to audit the content of `trivialnotes.sirius.cam` & `esm.run`.
